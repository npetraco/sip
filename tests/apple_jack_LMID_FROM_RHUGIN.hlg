Moral links:

    Marrying Sick1 and Dry1
    Marrying Sick and Dry
    Marrying Sick and Treat


Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    Loses1, Dry1, Sick1
This component is a clique of cost 8

Triangulating prime component with 6 members:
    Treat, Dry1, Sick1, Loses, Dry, Sick

    Using the best greedy heuristic for triangulation



Total cost of triangulation for all prime components is 48


Elimination sequence:

    Treat
    Sick
    Loses
    Dry
    Loses1
    Dry1
    Sick1


Cliques:

Clique 4, 3 members, table size = 8:
    Sick1, Dry1, Loses1

Clique 3, 3 members, table size = 8:
    Sick1, Dry1, Dry

Clique 2, 4 members, table size = 16:
    Sick1, Dry, Loses, Sick

Clique 1, 4 members, table size = 16:
    Sick1, Loses, Sick, Treat

Total clique table size: 48


The junction forest:

Creating junction tree with clique 4 as root ...

Cliques 3 and 4 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    Sick1, Dry1

Cliques 2 and 3 linked, separator has 2 members and table size = 4:
    Sick1, Dry

Cliques 1 and 2 linked, separator has 3 members and table size = 8:
    Sick1, Loses, Sick


Assignment of potentials to cliques:

    Node Profit assigned to clique 1
    Node Treat assigned to clique 1
    Node Harv assigned to clique 4
    Node Loses1 assigned to clique 4
    Node Dry1 assigned to clique 3
    Node Sick1 assigned to clique 1
    Node Loses assigned to clique 2
    Node Dry assigned to clique 3
    Node Sick assigned to clique 2


Checking conditional probability potentials:
