git init make a directory a git repos

git status
git add .    (or git add filename(s)) to stage in cache
git rm --cached filenames   to unstage
git commit -m "message"
git log

every time you do a commit the files staged in the cache to be committed are fluted. Once changes are made to files, they need to be restaged

git diff look at unstaged changes
git diff --cached look at staged changes


git log --oneline

shortcuts:
git commit -a -m "message"   add and commit
git status -s show files that have been modified

remote:
git remote add origin git@github.com:npetraco/sip.git    to tell local git where to push out the project to (the remote repos)

git push origin master   upload local repos to remote

If the following error is encountered:
error master -> master (non-fast-forward)

local and remote repos out of sync. Error message will probably tell you to do a pull. Execute:
git pull origin master
git add -A
git commit -m "modified code"
git push origin master
